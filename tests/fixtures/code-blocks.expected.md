## Code Examples

This article demonstrates various code formatting. Use `console.log()` for debugging and `Array.from()` for converting iterables.

Here is a JavaScript function with a language annotation:

```
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

And a Python example for comparison:

```
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

A code block without a language annotation:

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

HTML code with entities that must be preserved:

```
<div class="container">
  <p>Hello & welcome</p>
</div>
```

The `readFileSync` function reads files synchronously. That concludes our code examples.
