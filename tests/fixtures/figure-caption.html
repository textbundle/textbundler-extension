    <h1>Figures with Captions</h1>
    <p>This article demonstrates the figure element with images and captions. Figures should be preserved as inline HTML in the Markdown output.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://example.com/images/photo1.jpg" alt="A sunset over the ocean">
      <figcaption>A beautiful sunset captured at the coast.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The figure above has both an image and a caption. Below is a figure with only an image and no caption.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://example.com/images/photo2.png" alt="Mountain landscape">
    </figure>
    <p>And here is a figure with a linked image:</p>
    <figure>
      <a href="https://example.com/gallery"><img src="https://example.com/images/photo3.webp" alt="City skyline at night"></a>
      <figcaption>Click to view the full gallery.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>That concludes the figure examples. Each should be converted appropriately based on the custom Turndown rules.</p>
