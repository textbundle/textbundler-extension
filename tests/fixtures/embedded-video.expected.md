# Video Embeds in Articles

This article contains embedded video iframes from YouTube and Vimeo. These should be preserved as inline HTML in the Markdown output.

## YouTube Embed

Here is an embedded YouTube video demonstrating the feature:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

The YouTube embed above uses the standard iframe embed code.

## Vimeo Embed

And a Vimeo video for comparison:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148751763" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Vimeo video player"></iframe>

Both video embeds should survive the Markdown conversion as inline HTML since there is no Markdown equivalent for embedded video players.
