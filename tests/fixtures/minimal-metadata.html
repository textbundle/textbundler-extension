    <h1>Minimal Page</h1>
    <p>This page has only a title tag and bare body content. There are no Open Graph tags, no meta description, no JSON-LD structured data, no author meta tag, and no canonical link.</p>
    <p>The metadata extractor should still extract the title from the title element and populate the URL from the source URL. All other metadata fields should be null.</p>
    <p>This third paragraph provides enough content length for Readability to confidently identify the article region and extract it successfully.</p>
    <p>A fourth paragraph adds additional substance. Readability's heuristics typically require several hundred characters of text content within an identifiable article container.</p>
