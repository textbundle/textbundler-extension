## Figures with Captions

This article demonstrates the figure element with images and captions. Figures should be preserved as inline HTML in the Markdown output.

<figure><img src="assets/image-001.jpg" alt="A sunset over the ocean"><figcaption>A beautiful sunset captured at the coast.</figcaption></figure>

The figure above has both an image and a caption. Below is a figure with only an image and no caption.

<figure><img src="assets/image-002.png" alt="Mountain landscape"></figure>

And here is a figure with a linked image:

<figure><a href="https://example.com/gallery"><img src="assets/image-003.webp" alt="City skyline at night"></a><figcaption>Click to view the full gallery.</figcaption></figure>

That concludes the figure examples. Each should be converted appropriately based on the custom Turndown rules.
